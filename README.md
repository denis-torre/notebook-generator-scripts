# Notebook Generator Scripts
This repository contains a collection of Python and R scripts to analyze RNA-seq datasets.

### Overview
The repository is divided in multiple folders, which correspond to different versions of the scripts.  Each folder contains two files:
* An *init.ipy* file, which is used to initialize the Jupyter Notebook (e.g. loading Python and R libraries).
* A *Scripts.py* file, which contains Python analysis scripts.
* A *Scripts.R* file, which contains R analysis scripts.
