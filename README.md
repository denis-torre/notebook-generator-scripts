# Notebook Generator Scripts
This repository contains a collection of Python and R scripts to analyze RNA-seq datasets.

### Overview
The repository is divided in multiple folders, which correspond to different versions of the scripts.  Each folder contains two files:
* a init.ipy file, which is used to initialize the Jupyter Notebook (e.g. loading Python and R libraries)
* a Scripts.py file, which contains the analysis scripts used to analyze the data itself
